abstract = {In this paper we present a new lossless image compression algorithm. To achieve the high compression speed we use a linear prediction, modified Golomb–Rice code family, and a very fast prediction error modeling method. We compare the algorithm experimentally with others for medical and natural continuous tone grayscale images of depths of up to 16 bits. Its results are especially good for large images, for natural images of high bit depths, and for noisy images. The average compression speed on Intel Xeon 3.06 GHz CPU is 47 MB/s. For large images the speed is over 60 MB/s, i.e. the algorithm needs less than 50 CPU cycles per byte of image. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.}

abstract={We recognize that the key challenge in image compression is to efficiently represent and encode high-frequency image structure components, such as edges, patterns, and textures. In this work, we develop an efficient lossless image compression scheme called super-spatial structure prediction. This super-spatial prediction is motivated by motion prediction in video coding, attempting to find an optimal prediction of structure components within previously encoded image regions. We find that this super-spatial prediction is very efficient for image regions with significant structure components. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is very competitive and even outperforms the state-of-the-art lossless image compression methods.},

abstract={In many practical scenarios, image encryption has to be conducted prior to image compression. This has led to the problem of how to design a pair of image encryption and compression algorithms such that compressing the encrypted images can still be efficiently performed. In this paper, we design a highly efficient image encryption-then-compression (ETC) system, where both lossless and lossy compression are considered. The proposed image encryption scheme operated in the prediction error domain is shown to be able to provide a reasonably high level of security. We also demonstrate that an arithmetic coding-based approach can be exploited to efficiently compress the encrypted images. More notably, the proposed compression approach applied to encrypted images is only slightly worse, in terms of compression efficiency, than the state-of-the-art lossless/lossy image coders, which take original, unencrypted images as inputs. In contrast, most of the existing ETC solutions induce significant penalty on the compression efficiency.},

title={Hierarchical Prediction and Context Adaptive Coding for Lossless Color Image Compression},

abstract={This paper presents a new lossless color image compression algorithm, based on the hierarchical prediction and context-adaptive arithmetic coding. For the lossless compression of an RGB image, it is first decorrelated by a reversible color transform and then Y component is encoded by a conventional lossless grayscale image compression method. For encoding the chrominance images, we develop a hierarchical scheme that enables the use of upper, left, and lower pixels for the pixel prediction, whereas the conventional raster scan prediction methods use upper and left pixels. An appropriate context model for the prediction error is also defined and the arithmetic coding is applied to the error signal corresponding to each context. For several sets of images, it is shown that the proposed method further reduces the bit rates compared with JPEG2000 and JPEG-XR.},
